#####################  model fit
The folder "model fit" contains R files for fitting the Bayesian-GRM, testing model fit, and performing cross-validation.
1. Fitting the Bayesian-GRM to training data (Section 3.1): "Bayesian_GRM_scoff.R" and "Bayesian_GRM_base.R".
2. Predicting individual ED risk using fitted Bayesian-GRM (Section 3.2): "ED_risk_estimate_scoff.R" and "ED_risk_estimate_base.R".
3. Cross-validation using out-of-sample method (Section 3.3): "cross_validation_scoff.R" and "cross_validation_base.R".
4. Figure 2 (posterior predictive comparison): plotted by "posterior_predictive_scoff.R" and "posterior_predictive_base.R".
5. Figure 3 (cross-validation results): plotted by "plot_cross_validation.R".
